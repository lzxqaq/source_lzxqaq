> My third story is about death.

> 我的第三个故事是关于死亡的。

> When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: "If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you'll most certainly be right."

> 17岁那年，我读到了一句话，它是这样说的：“如果你把每一天都当作生命中的最后一天去过，总有一天你会如愿以偿。”

> It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself:

> 这句话给我留下了深刻的印象。从那时开始，33年过去了，我在每天早晨都会对着镜子问自己：

> "If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?"

> “如果今天是我生命中的最后一天，我还会去做你今天想做的事情吗？“

> And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.

> 当一连很多天我的回答都是“不”的时候，我知道自己应该有所改变了。

> Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.

> “记住你随时都将死去”是我一生中遇到的最重要的箴言。它帮我做了生命中很多重要的选择。

> Because almost everything—all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure—

> 因为几乎所有的事情，包括所有的期待、骄傲、所有对难堪和失败的恐惧——

> these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.

> 它们在死亡面前都会消失，看到的是留下的真正重要的东西。

> Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.

> 记住自己随时都会死去是我知道的避免患得患失最好的而办法。

> You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.

> 你已经一无所有了，没有理由不去跟随自己的感觉走。

> About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer.

> 大概一年以前，我被诊断出患有癌症。

> I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas. I didn't even know what a pancreas was.

> 那天早晨七点半，我做了一个扫描检查，检查结果清楚表明我的胰腺上有一个肿瘤。我当时都不知道胰腺是什么东西。

> The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months.

> 医生告诉我那几乎是一种无法治愈的癌症，我最多还可以活三到六个月。

> My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor's code for prepare to die.

> 医生建议我回家把一切事情都安排好，其实那就是医生在暗示我准备后事。

> It means to try and tell your kids everything you thought you'd have the next ten years to tell them in just a few months.

> 那意味着你将要把未来十年对你小孩说的话在几个月里嘱咐完。

> It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family. It means to say your goodbyes.

> 意味着把每件事情都安排妥当，让你的家人会尽可能轻松的生活。那意味着你要说“再见“了。

>I lived with that diagnosis all day.

> 我整天心里都想着那个诊断书。

> Later that evening I had a biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my stomach and into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor.

> 到了晚上，我做了一个组织切片检查。医生将一个内窥镜通过我的喉咙伸进我的胃，然后进入我的肠子，用一根针在我的胰腺上的肿瘤上取了几个细胞。

> I was sedated, but my wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery.

> 我当时被麻醉了，但是我的妻子在那里。她后来告诉我，当医生在显微镜下观察到这些细胞的时候叫了起来，原来这些细胞竟然是一种罕见的可以用手术治愈的胰腺癌症。

> I had the surgery and thankfully I'm fine now.

> 于是我做了手术，现在已经痊愈了。

> This was the closest I've been to facing death, and I hope it's the closest I get for a few more decades.

> 那是我离死亡最近的时候，我也希望这是以后的几十年最接近的一次。

> Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept: No one wants to die.

> 有了这次经历之后，现在我可以更加确定地和你们谈论死亡，而不觉得死亡只是一个有帮助性的纯粹的知识上的概念，我可以更肯定地对你们说：没有人愿意死。

> Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there.

> 即使那些想上天堂的人也不愿意死后再进。

> And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it.

> 然而死亡是我们的共同归宿，没人能逃脱。

> And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life.

> 我们注定会死，因为死亡很可能是生命中最好的一项发明。

> It is Life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new.

> 它推进生命的变更，除去旧的，迎来新的。


> Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it's quite true.

> 现在，你们就是新的，但是不久以后，你们将会逐渐变成旧的，然后被淘汰。抱歉我把话说得这么过头，但这千真万确。

> Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.

> 时间有限，不要按照别人的意愿来活，这是浪费时间。

> Don't be trapped by dogma—which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice.

> 不要被教条所束缚，那是为别人的设想而活。不要让他人的意见淹没自己的心声。

> And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.

> 最重要的是，鼓起勇气，跟着自己的心和直觉前行。不管怎样，感觉和直觉早就知道你想成为什么样的人，其它都是次要的。

> When I was young, there was an amazing publication called The Whole Earth Catalog, which was one of the bibles of my generation.

> 我年轻的时候有一本很好的期刊，叫做《全球概览》，它是我们那代人的宝书之一。

> It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand not far from here in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his poetic touch.

> 作者是斯图尔特-布兰德，住在离这儿不远的门罗帕克市。他用他诗一般的语言将期刊描写得栩栩如生。

> This was in the late 1960's, before personal computers and desktop publishing, so it was all made with typewriters, scissors, and polaroid cameras.

> 那是20世纪60年代，还没有个人电脑和台式机，全靠打字机、剪刀和宝丽来照相。

> It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along: it was idealistic, overflowing with neat tools and great notions.

> 它就像纸质版的谷歌，却比谷歌早问世了35年。这份期刊太完美了，查阅手段齐全，构思不凡。

> Stewart and his team put out several issues of The Whole Earth Catalog, and then when it had run its course, they put out a final issue.

> 斯图尔特和他的团队出了好几期《全球概览》，到最后办不下去的时候，他们出了最后一期。

> It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age. On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous.

> 那是20世纪70年代中期，那时我也跟你们一样大。在他们最后一期的后封面上是一张清晨乡间小路的照片，是那种爱冒险的人等在那儿搭便车的那种小路。

> Beneath it were the words: "Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish." It was their farewell message as they signed off. Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.

> 照片下面写着一行字：“好学若饥，谦卑若愚。“这是他们停刊前的告别词。

> And I have always wished that for myself. And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you.
Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.

> 这也是我一直想要做到的。现在，你们也要毕业了，要开始新的生活，希望你们也能做到。

> Thank you all very much.

> 谢谢大家。
