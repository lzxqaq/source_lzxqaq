> —— Steve Jobs

> My second story is about love and loss.

> 我的第二个故事是关于爱与得失的。

> I was lucky —— I found what I loved to do early in life.

> 我很幸运，因为我在很早的时候就发现了自己钟爱的东西。

> Woz and I started Apple in my parents' garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in ten years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage ito a $2 billion company with over 4,000 employess.

> 我在二十岁的时候就和沃兹在父母的车库里面开创了苹果公司。我们工作很努力，十年之后，苹果公司从那两个车库中的穷光蛋发展到了拥有四千多名雇员、价值超过二十亿的大公司。

> We had just released our finest creation —— the Macintosh —— a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired.

> 一年前，我们刚刚发布了最好的产品 —— Macintosh，我也快要到三十岁了。而就在那年，我被解雇了。

> How can you get fired from a company you started?

> 你怎么会被你自己创立的公司炒鱿鱼呢？

> Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the compay with me, and for the first year or so things went well.

> 是这样的，随着苹果公司越做越大，我们雇用了一个很有才华的家伙和我一起管理这个公司，在最初的几年，公司运转得很好。

> But then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out.

> 但是后来我们对未来的看法产生了分歧，最终我们反目了。

> When we did, out Board of Directors sided with him. And so at 30 I was out. And very publicly out. What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating.

> 当我们吵得不可开交的时候，董事会站在了他的那边。所以三十岁的那年，我离开了公司。在这么多人的眼皮下我离开了公司。我的生命的全部支柱离自己远去，这真是毁灭性的打击。

> I really didn't know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down —— that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me.

> 在接下来的几个月里，我真的不知道该做些什么。我感觉自己让老一代的创业者失望了，因为我扔掉了交到自己手里的接力棒。

> I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly. I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the valley.

> 我去简历戴维帕卡德和鲍勃诺伊斯，想为自己把事情搞得这么糟说声道歉。这次失败弄得沸沸扬扬的，我甚至想过逃离硅谷。

> But something slowly began to dawn on me —— I still loved what I did.

> 但是我渐渐发现，我仍然喜爱我从事的这些东西。

> The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I had been rejected, but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over.

> 苹果公司发生的这些事情丝毫没有改变这一点。我虽然被拒之门外，但是我仍然热爱我的事业，所以我决定从头再来。

> I didn't see it then, but it truned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me.

> 我当时并没有意识到，但事后证明，被苹果公司炒鱿鱼是我这辈子碰到最好的一件事。

> The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. I freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.

> 从头开始的轻松感取代了保持成功的沉重感。这让我觉得如此自由，使我进入了人生中最有创造力的一个阶段。

> During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar, and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife.

> 在接下来的五年里，我创立了一个名叫 NeXT 的公司和名叫 Pixar 的公司，与一位了不起的女人相爱，最终结婚。

> Pixar went on to create the world's first computer animated feature film, Toy Story, and is now the most successful animation studio in the world.

> Pixar 推出了世界上第一个用电脑制作的动画电影 ——— 《玩具总动员》，Pixar 现在也是世界上最成功的动画制作室。

> In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, and I returned to Apple, and the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple's current renaissance. And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together.

> 世道轮回，苹果公司收购了 NeXT，然后我又回到了苹果公司。我们在 NeXT 开发的技术成了苹果公司重新崛起的核心。我和劳伦那也建立了美满的家庭。

> I'm pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple. It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it.

> 我可以非常肯定地说，如果我不被苹果公司解雇，这一切决不可能发生。这是一剂苦药，但我认为苦药利于病。

> Sometimes life is gonna hit you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith.

> 有时候生活会给你当头一棒，但不要灰心。

> I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did.You've got to find what you love. And that is as true for work as it is for your lovers.

> 我坚信唯一使我一直坚持下去的就是我对所做事情的无比热爱。所以你一定要清楚自己喜欢什么，选择爱人时如此，找寻工作亦如此。

> Your work is gonna fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.

> 你的工作将会占据生活的很大的一部分。让自己真正满意的唯一方法就是做自己认为有意义的工作；做有意义的工作的唯一办法就是热爱自己的工作。

> If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. And don't settle.

> 如果你吸纳在还没有发现自己喜欢什么，那就继续寻找，不要急于作出决定。

> As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on.

> 用心地去寻找，只有这样，当你发现的时候你就会感觉到。正如任何真挚的关系都是历久弥新。

> So keep looking. Don't settle.

> 所以继续寻找，直到找到自己喜欢的东西。
