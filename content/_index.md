It doesn't interest me what you do for a living.I want to know what you ache for and if you dare to dream of meeting your heart's longing.
It doesn't interest me how old you are.I want to know if you will risk looking like a fool for love for your dream for the adventure of being alive.
It doesn't interest me what planets are squaring your moon...I want to know if you have touched the centre of your own sorrow if you have been opened by life's betrayals or have become shrivelled and closed from fear of further pain.
It doesn't interest me who you know or how you came to be here.I want to know if you will stand in the centre of the fire with me and not shrink back.  

你好，我是罗泽勋，从事于软件开发工作。2021年我从华南“思饭”大学毕业，带着三个悬而未决的问题（如何与自己相处、如何与他人相处、如何与世界相处），进入社会工作。二十多年的过往经历，我深感生命的短暂、个人的渺小。因此，我追求高效的工作效率、乐观充实的生活。我的人情观念较为淡薄，我认为真挚友好的交流应该建立在彼此“认识”的基础上。我不曾想改变他人，也不曾想改变这世界。如果有人的生活因我而更轻松，我会很高兴。
