It doesn't interest me what you do for a living.I want to know what you ache for and if you dare to dream of meeting your heart's longing.
It doesn't interest me how old you are.I want to know if you will risk looking like a fool for love for your dream for the adventure of being alive.
It doesn't interest me what planets are squaring your moon...I want to know if you have touched the centre of your own sorrow if you have been opened by life's betrayals or have become shrivelled and closed from fear of further pain.
It doesn't interest me who you know or how you came to be here.I want to know if you will stand in the centre of the fire with me and not shrink back.  

你好，我是罗泽勋，从事软件开发工作。2021年我从华南“思饭”大学毕业，带着三个悬而未决的问题（如何与自己相处、如何与他人相处、如何与世界相处），开启人生的下一段旅程。一路走来，我得到很多人的帮助，在他们身上学到很多积极的东西。二十多年的人生旅程，我深切体会到个人的渺小、生命的短暂。因此，我在此建立了个人主页，希望它就像那“希比欧”一样，编织出无可替代的时间故事。我追求着高效的工作、乐观充实的生活。我不曾想改变他人，也不曾想改变世界，但若有人的生活因我而更轻松，我会很高兴。
