> I can listen no longer in silence. I must speak to you by such means as are within my reach.

> 我无法再沉默地听下去了。我必须用我的能力所及的方式想你述说。

> You pierce my soul.I am half agony, half hope.

> 你刺痛了我的灵魂。我心中一半是痛苦，一半是希望。

> Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feeling are gone for ever.

> 不要告诉我来得太迟，不要说那种珍贵的感情已经永远离开了。

> I offer myself to you again with a heart even more your own than when you almost broke it, eight years and a half ago.

> 我再次把我的心交给你，甚至比八年半前你将它撕碎时更加忠于你。

> Dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman, that his love has an earlier death.

> 我不敢说男人比女人会更快忘记一段感情，不敢说男人爱的期限更短。

> I have loved none but you.

> 除你以外，我没有爱过任何人。
