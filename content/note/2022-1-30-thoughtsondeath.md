> My third story is about death.

> 我的第三个故事是关于死亡的。

> When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: "If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you'll most certainly be right."

> 17岁那年，我读到了一句话，它是这样说的：“如果你把每一天都当作生命中的最后一天去过，总有一天你会如愿以偿。”

> It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself:

> 这句话给我留下了深刻的印象。从那时开始，33年过去了，我在每天早晨都会对着镜子问自己：

> "If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?"

> “如果今天是我生命中的最后一天，我还会去做你今天想做的事情吗？“

> And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.

> 当一连很多天我的回答都是“不”的时候，我知道自己应该有所改变了。

> Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.

> “记住你随时都将死去”是我一生中遇到的最重要的箴言。它帮我做了生命中很多重要的选择。

> Because almost everything—all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure—

> 因为几乎所有的事情，包括所有的期待、骄傲、所有对难堪和失败的恐惧——

> these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.

> 它们在死亡面前都会消失，看到的是留下的真正重要的东西。

> Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.

> 记住自己随时都会死去是我知道的避免患得患失最好的而办法。

> You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.

> 你已经一无所有了，没有理由不去跟随自己的感觉走。

> About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer.

> 大概一年以前，我被诊断出患有癌症。

> I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas. I didn't even know what a pancreas was.

> 那天早晨七点半，我做了一个扫描检查，检查结果清楚表明我的胰腺上有一个肿瘤。我当时都不知道胰腺是什么东西。

> The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months.

> 医生告诉我那几乎是一种无法治愈的癌症，我最多还可以活三到六个月。

> My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor's code for prepare to die.

> 医生建议我回家把一切事情都安排好，其实那就是医生在暗示我准备后事。

> It means to try and tell your kids everything you thought you'd have the next ten years to tell them in just a few months.

> 那意味着你将要把未来十年对你小孩说的话在几个月里嘱咐完。

> It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family. It means to say your goodbyes.

> 意味着把每件事情都安排妥当，让你的家人会尽可能轻松的生活。那意味着你要说“再见“了。

>I lived with that diagnosis all day.

> 我整天心里都想着那个诊断书。

> Later that evening I had a biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my stomach and into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor.

> 到了晚上，我做了一个组织切片检查。医生将一个内窥镜通过我的喉咙伸进我的胃，然后进入我的肠子，用一根针在我的胰腺上的肿瘤上取了几个细胞。

> I was sedated, but my wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery.

> 我当时被麻醉了，但是我的妻子在那里。她后来告诉我，当医生在显微镜下观察到这些细胞的时候叫了起来，原来这些细胞竟然是一种罕见的可以用手术治愈的胰腺癌症。

> I had the surgery and thankfully I'm fine now.

> 于是我做了手术，现在已经痊愈了。

> This was the closest I've been to facing death, and I hope it's the closest I get for a few more decades.

> 那是我离死亡最近的时候，我也希望这是以后的几十年最接近的一次。

> Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept: No one wants to die.

> 有了这次经历之后，现在我可以更加确定地和你们谈论死亡，而不觉得死亡只是一个有帮助性的纯粹的知识上的概念，我可以更肯定地对你们说：没有人愿意死。

> Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there.

> 即使那些想上天堂的人也不愿意死后再进。

> And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it.

> 然而死亡是我们的共同归宿，没人能逃脱。

> And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life.

> 我们注定会死，因为死亡很可能是生命中最好的一项发明。

> It is Life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new.

> 它推进生命的变更，除去旧的，迎来新的。
